# Printrbot-Marlin-Firmware

This is my modified version of the mainstream Marlin Firmware. I wanted to add some 
Neopixel LED's to my modified Printrbot Simple Metal, and the Printrbot firmware was 
kinda outdated and didn't have many of the new marlin features. My modifications 
include a Matrix Precision volume upgrade, E3D V6 Hot End-thermistor, and a Printrbot
LED strip. I made changes in 3 Files Configuration.h, Configuration_adv.h, and
Marlin.ino. _
